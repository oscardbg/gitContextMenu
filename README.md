# gitContextMenu
Add open git bash and cmder in context menu

This is not my code this is just the recopilation of code from some websites and youtube videos of poeople who made it and this works for me.

I tried powershell and git bash but i when i found about cmder i knew it would be the best choice for me so i look in some websites and this helped add the "open in cmder option in context menu".

Now i only use cmder but just in case someone needs one or the other i uploaded both files.
